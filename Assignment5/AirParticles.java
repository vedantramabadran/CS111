/*
 * Fine air particles can come from power plants, motor vehicles, airplanes, 
 * residential wood burning, forest fires, agricultural burning, volcanic eruptions,
 * and dust storms.
 *
 * Particles smaller than 2.5 micrometers are able to bypass the nose and throat
 * and penetrate deep into the lungs and some may even enter the circulatory system.
 * 
 * Due to the many adverse effects fine particles can inflict on a large number of people, 
 * PM2.5 is one of the major pollutants closely monitored by health authorities around the world. 
 * You will most likely come across a dedicated column for PM2.5 alongside the Air Quality Index (AQI), 
 * Pollutants Standards Index (PSI) or the air quality standards adopted by your country.
 *
 * Refer to the assignment description on the website.
